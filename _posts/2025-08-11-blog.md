ChatGPT 5 isn’t just a “new model number.” It brings deeper reasoning, better routing between fast and thinking modes, agentic browsing/automation, and quality‑of‑life tools that make it useful _day to day_. Below are the most effective workflows I’ve tested — with copy‑paste prompts you can use as a starting point.

> **Tip:** In ChatGPT, select **GPT‑5**. It decides when to switch into **Thinking** for harder tasks. You don’t have to toggle it manually — but you _can_ ask it to “think step‑by‑step and verify each claim,” which nudges the deeper mode.

#### 1) Research that actually finishes (Deep Research + Agent)

**When to use:** Market scans, lit reviews, product comps, due diligence.

**How I run it**

1. Start with:  
   _“Act as a research lead. Create a plan first: sources to check, search operators, evaluation criteria. Then execute the plan. Log sources and a confidence score per finding.”_
2. Add constraints: timeframe, geographies, competitor list, must‑answer questions.
3. Let **Agent mode** browse, open pages, and extract facts. Ask for **source‑linked evidence** and a short **“what this means”** verdict after each section.
4. Finish with: _“Give me a one‑page brief + a 6‑slide outline, and export a table of citations (title, author, date, URL, why it’s credible).”_

**Deliverables I request**

- 1‑pager brief (markdown)
- Slide outline with titles + talking points
- CSV/Sheet with sources

#### 2) Coding partner that ships

**When to use:** Greenfield features, refactors, tests, debugging.

**Prompts that work**

- _“Here’s the repo context (paste key files). Propose an implementation plan with milestones. Guardrails: lint rules, test coverage target, perf budget.”_
- _“Write the module **and** tests. Then run a code review on your own diff and propose simplifications.”_
- _“Switch to Thinking and reason about edge cases before writing code. Produce a checklist, then implement.”_

**Patterns I like**

- Ask for a **fails‑first test** plan before code.
- Have it **explain trade‑offs** (libraries, complexity, perf) and commit to one.
- Request a **migration plan** (scripts, rollback, observability).

#### 3) Writing that lands

**Use cases:** Emails, briefs, PRDs, blogs, job posts, performance reviews.

**Prompt frame**

> _“Audience: hiring managers in data teams. Goal: book intro calls. Voice: warm, direct, credible. Tone: concrete, no fluff. Constraints: 140–180 words, 1 CTA, at most 1 emoji. Draft 3 options, then critique and combine into a final.”_

**Polish**

- _“Rewrite with a stronger hook and a single through‑line.”_
- _“List 5 headlines with different angles (authority, curiosity, numbers, contrarian, social proof).”_
- _“Fact‑check every claim; add inline citations or mark as anecdotal.”_

---

#### 4) Ongoing work you don’t want to babysit (Tasks)

Set **Tasks** for recurring work so ChatGPT runs on its own and pings you with results.

**Ideas**

- Daily **industry brief** at 8am with 5 links and “why it matters.”
- Weekly **lead list** from public pages (company, role, location) exported as CSV.
- Monthly **resume refresh**: summarize new projects, quantify outcomes, update bullets.
- **Learning plan**: 3 micro‑lessons per week + spaced‑repetition quiz.

**One‑liner you can paste**

> _“Every weekday at 8:00, scan top sources for [YOUR TOPIC]. Send a 6‑bullet briefing (50–80 chars per bullet) with links, a 2‑sentence analysis, and a confidence score. If nothing meaningful, say ‘no significant updates’.”_

---

#### 5) Agentic execution (browse, log in, produce deliverables)

For multi‑step asks that mix browsing, data extraction, analysis, and output:

**Prompt skeleton**

1. _“Plan out the steps before acting.”_
2. _“While browsing, save a log of visited pages (URL, title, why relevant).”_
3. _“If a login is needed, prompt me; do not store credentials.”_
4. _“Create deliverables: (a) editable slide deck, (b) spreadsheet, (c) summary memo.”_

**Great tasks**

- Competitor teardown → deck + scorecard
- Vendor shortlist → spreadsheet with weighted criteria
- Content calendar → CSV + Notion‑ready markdown

#### 6) Better prompting in GPT‑5 (quick rules)

- **Set the role, audience, goal, and constraints.**
- **Ask it to plan first, then execute.**
- **Request verification:** citations, tests, or lint rules.
- **Use iterations:** “v1 → critique → v2.”
- **Be explicit about formatting:** tables, JSON, CSV, markdown sections.

Copy‑paste starter:

{% raw %}

> _“You are my "role". Audience: "who". Goal: "what". Constraints: length, tone, format. First: propose a plan with steps, risks, and acceptance criteria. Then execute. Use Thinking for non-trivial reasoning. End with a QA checklist.”_
> {% endraw %}

---

#### 7) API / developer notes (mini)

- In the API, GPT‑5 is strong at **agentic** and **coding** tasks. Reach for it when you need end‑to‑end implementations, analysis, or tool use.
- Consider routing trivial tasks to lighter models; use GPT‑5 for the complex parts.
- Capture **traces** and **evals** so you can compare Chat vs. Thinking on your use case.

#### Final thoughts

Day‑to‑day usefulness comes from _workflow design_ more than raw model horsepower. With ChatGPT 5, the biggest gains show up when you let it plan first, verify outputs, and automate the routines so you can focus on judgment calls.
